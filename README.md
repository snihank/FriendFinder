# FriendFinder

This app works as taking in some information in a survey page and match with existing people to return names of the best matches of people.

We have used HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap, node and express. 

The home page provides a welcome and a link to take in the survey, along with existing friends data and github links. 

The survey page depicts the questions to answer and when clicked on submit, it displays a modal with the closest match, however, if any field is empty, it does not go through.
